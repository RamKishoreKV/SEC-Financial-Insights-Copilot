Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business is subject to rapid technological change, competitive pressures in smartphones, personal computers, and services, reliance on third-party manufacturing and component suppliers, and global economic conditions affecting consumer demand. Disruptions in supply chain logistics, including constraints on semiconductor and display availability, could materially affect product cost and availability. Regulatory developments related to privacy, app store practices, and digital services, as well as trade policies and tariffs, could negatively impact our financial performance. Currency fluctuations and geopolitical instability may also adversely affect revenue and margins.
